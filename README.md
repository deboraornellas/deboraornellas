### Hello there! ðŸ¤©

I'm DÃ©bora, a software developer (she/her) from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, currently based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Currently working for the LEGO Group, which is really exciting!
My main stack is currently React, Node, GQL and AWS Serverless.

Main focus for me in 2022 is Javascript: understanding the good and bad parts and applying this knowledge on the products I'm working on.

Software testing has been one of my favourite tech topics for a while! I'm looking forward to learning more about the current tools and libraries (Cypress, react-testing-library, Jest...) and hopefully contributing to them.

Oh, I'm also a documentation evangelist. Well documented codebases make me rejoice.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy bouldering, photography, drawing and singing.
