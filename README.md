### Hello there! ðŸ¤©

I'm DÃ©bora, a software engineer (she/her) from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, currently based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. 
I've been working for the LEGO Group since Feb 2022. My main stack is React/NextJS, CSS Modules, Apollo GQL, Node and AWS Serverless.

I'm a maintainer on SkrÃ¸ll, a shopper design system for LEGO.com built on design tokens. It's not currently open source :/ but in the future it could be!

My current focus is on deepening my knowledge of Web Accessibility, Front-end performance and CSS styling (animations, transitions, understanding new features).

Oh, I'm also a documentation evangelist. I love Storybook! Well documented codebases make me rejoice.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy photography, drawing, singing and gymnastics (although my tumbling skills are very basic).
