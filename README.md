### Hello there! ðŸ¤©

I'm DÃ©bora, a software developer (she/her) from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, currently based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. Currently working for the LEGO Group, which is really exciting!
My main stack is currently React, CSS Modules, Node, GQL and AWS Serverless.

We're currently building SkrÃ¸ll, a new design system for LEGO.com build on design tokens. It's not currently open source :/ but in the future it could be!

In 2023 I'm focusing in two different areas. One is improving my FE expertise (HTML, CSS, JS). The second is getting a better understanding of cloud engineering.

Oh, I'm also a documentation evangelist. I love Storybook! Well documented codebases make me rejoice.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy bouldering, photography, drawing and singing.
