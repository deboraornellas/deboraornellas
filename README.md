### Hello there! ðŸ¤©

I'm DÃ©bora, a software engineer (she/her) from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, currently based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. 
My main stack is React/NextJS, HTML, CSS, Apollo GQL, Node and AWS Serverless.

My current focus is on deepening my knowledge of Web Accessibility, Front-end performance and CSS styling (animations, transitions, understanding new features).

Oh, I'm also a documentation evangelist. I love Storybook! Well documented codebases make me rejoice.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy photography, drawing, singing and gymnastics (but my tumbling skills are very basic!).
