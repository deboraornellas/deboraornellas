### Hello there! ðŸ¤©

I'm DÃ©bora, a software developer (she/her) from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· , currently based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ . 
I currently work at Theodo UK, building web and mobile apps :)
My main stack is currently React, React Native, Node (including NestJS) and AWS Serverless.

Software testing has been one of my favourite tech topics for a while! I'm looking forward to learning more about the current tools and libraries (Cypress, Detox, react-testing-library, Jest...) and hopefully contributing to them.

Besides tech stuff, I really enjoy bouldering, photography, drawing and singing.
